## Some TODOs that I didn't get to:
- Make `Show More` buttons functional (although currently there's no more than 5 books to show for each section so more books would need to be added to the json file)
- Make site more responsive and add breakpoint so that books switch to full-width columns when on medium-small screens
- Add functionality for books with multiple authors that adds commas in between each
- Update footer to use reactstrap instead of vanilla bootstrap
- Clean-up unused boilerplate code from create-react-app
